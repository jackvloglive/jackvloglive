**`Fullstack Web Engineer`**

Iâ€™m a neurodivergent full-stack engineer from New Zealand pushing to make my space in the world one step at a time. All my projects are designed from the ground up and built for practice and experience. Design and programming gave me an escape to work visually and with my hands in a stress-free environment.
